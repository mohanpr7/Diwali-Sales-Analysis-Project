# Diwali Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview:
The **Diwali Sales Data Analysis** project focuses on understanding customer buying behavior, identifying top-selling products, and analyzing sales trends during the Diwali festive season. Using **Python** libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, the data was cleaned, processed, and visualized to reveal meaningful insights that help businesses optimize their sales and marketing strategies.

## Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Python**: For data analysis, manipulation, and visualization
  - **Pandas**: Data cleaning and manipulation
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and analysis

## Key Objectives:
- Analyze sales data to identify top-selling products, customer demographics, and purchasing patterns during Diwali.
- Perform data cleaning and manipulation to ensure accuracy in the analysis.
- Visualize trends in sales performance using bar charts, histograms, and line plots to understand customer preferences.
- Provide recommendations for future marketing strategies and sales improvements based on insights.

## Dataset:
The dataset includes Diwali sales records with key information such as:
- **Customer ID**, **Gender**, **Age Group**, **Occupation**
- **City Tier**, **Product Category**, **Product ID**, **Sales**
- **Quantity**, **Discount**, **Profit**

## Key Analyses:
1. **Top-Selling Products**: Identified the most popular products and categories during the Diwali season.
2. **Customer Demographics**: Analyzed customer purchasing behavior based on age groups, gender, occupation, and city tier.
3. **Sales Trends**: Visualized daily and monthly sales performance to track peak sales days during the Diwali period.
4. **Discount vs Profit Analysis**: Evaluated the impact of discounts on profitability across product categories.
5. **Customer Segmentation**: Segmented customers by demographics to understand preferences and drive targeted marketing campaigns.

## Data Cleaning & Processing:
- Handled missing values, incorrect data entries, and inconsistencies in the dataset using **Pandas**.
- Performed data transformations to calculate new metrics such as **total revenue**, **average order value**, and **profit margins**.

## Visualizations:
- **Bar Charts**: Displayed top-selling products and sales distribution across customer segments.
- **Line Plots**: Visualized sales trends throughout the Diwali season.
- **Histograms**: Showed the distribution of customers by age group, gender, and occupation.
- **Scatter Plots**: Analyzed the relationship between discounts offered and profit generated.

## Project Results:
- Identified the top-selling product categories and their contribution to overall sales.
- Revealed that **Age Group 26-35** and **Tier 1 cities** had the highest purchasing power during the Diwali season.
- Discovered that higher discounts on certain products led to increased sales but impacted profit margins.
- Provided actionable insights into which customer demographics to target for future Diwali sales campaigns.

## Conclusion:
The **Diwali Sales Data Analysis** project provided valuable insights into customer behavior and product performance during the festive season. By analyzing the data with Python and visualizing key trends, the project offers recommendations for enhancing future marketing efforts and boosting sales profitability.

## How to Use:
1. **Jupyter Notebook**: Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook to review the code and analysis step-by-step.
2. **Python Scripts**: The `scripts/` folder contains Python scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
3. **Dataset**: The raw dataset used in the project can be found in the `data/` folder.

## Future Enhancements:
- Add **predictive modeling** to forecast future Diwali sales trends.
- Analyze customer feedback and reviews to gain deeper insights into customer satisfaction.
- Implement **A/B testing** to determine the effectiveness of different discount strategies.
